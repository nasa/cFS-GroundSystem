# Filename: CHeaderParser.py
#
# Created in Winter 2014-15
# Created by Winter Intern for NASA GSFC Code 582
#
# Edited by: Keegan Moore
# Summer Intern for NASA GSFC Code 582
# Note about edits:
#	findDataTypeNew() - kept the same
#	getFileList() - completely new utility for determining which files to use
#	__main__ - significant changes made to main code
#		- kept class functionality
#		- presents data to user rather than asking user to look in hdr file
#		- preserved pickle utility so the rest of the ground system remains
#			the same
#
##############################################################################
# Description:
#	CHeaderParser.py is designed to help automate the process of adding
# core Flight System (cFS) application commands and parameters to the
# python-based ground system that should come with this file. By prompting
# the user for necessary information, and parsing the cFS header files, this
# program will generate up to two different "pickle" files for the ground
# system to use (for information about pickle files and the pickle python
# library, see the link here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).
# These files will be placed in CommandFiles/ or ParameterFiles/.
#
# Usage:
#	This program requires the directory path to the application header file
# that contains both the Command Code Definitions and the Command Structures.
# This program, by default, looks in 'CHeaderParser-hdr-paths.txt' for the
# path to the files. If the user is inputting multiple header files, the user
# can enter the path to each header file on a new line.
#
# Examples:
# ~$ python CHeaderParser.py
#	The above command would look in CHeaderParser-hdr-paths.txt for its list
#	of header paths.
